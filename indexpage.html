     Bhoramdev Jungle Retreat(BJR) is a great example of rural tourism done
     right.many a times rural tourism can seem intrusive,like walking into someone's
     house unannounced.many tour operators and hotels in india peddle various -
     tourism but much of it involves tourists gawking at locals as they go about
     their daily lives with very little humans interaction between the guest's
     and the hosts.<br>   
                      <br>Satyendra 'Sunny' Upadhyay,who started BJR about a decade
     and a half back,did not want to do such "humans-safari's".
   
     His homestay is located in Bhoramdev in chhattisgarh,about three hours away
     from the state capital raipur.the place is known for the Bhoramdev Templex
     complex,dedicated to shiva and constructed between 7th and 12th centuries,
     renowed for its sculptures covered structures.

Sunny, who runs the place along with his Swiss wife Sabrina, is from nearby Kawardha and was
a guide at the Kawardha Palace before starting BJR. His years as a tourist guide made him realise
that the interactions that tourists had with the local community and the glimpses they got of the
local culture and practices is what set a trip apart for them more than the tours of the built 
heritage of the region. He also understood how tourism needed to be respectful for local people.
